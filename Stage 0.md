# **RNA Seq**

 

## 1. **Introduction**

RNA sequencing, or RNA-Seq, makes use of high-throughput sequencing techniques to reveal information about a cell's transcriptomics \[1\], which is the entire collection of RNA transcripts made by the genome in a particular cell or under particular conditions \[2\]. Cancer is a disease that is both aggressive and diverse. It continues to provide challenges in research and treatment. RNA Seq is an essential tool that has been used in many areas of cancer research and therapy. Some of these areas are biomarker discovery, understanding tumor heterogeneity, tumor profiling, and personalized medicine \[3\].


## 2. **RNA Seq**

With the help of RNA Seq, a more comprehensive and objective understanding of the transcriptome's complex and dynamic structure can be obtained. The steps involved in the RNA Seq procedure are as follows: RNA extraction, library building, sequencing, and data analysis \[4\].

RNA-Seq can be used to study several populations of RNA, including total RNA, pre-mRNA, and noncoding RNA, such as microRNA and long non-coding RNA, in addition to polyadenylated messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts \[1\].

In order to identify potential therapeutic targets for tailored treatment, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project uses RNA-Seq technology to generate a comprehensive transcriptome profile of 33 cancer types, one of which is ovarian cancer \[4\].

The deadliest type of gynecologic cancer is ovarian cancer, which ranks as the sixth most common cause of cancer-related mortality for women in the United States. Early detection is critical to achieving long-term sickness control and lowering mortality. In addition to the challenges associated with early-stage diagnosis, multidrug resistance (MDR) development is a contributing factor to the high death rate associated with ovarian cancer. Our understanding of the molecular carcinogenesis and pathological etiology of ovarian cancer has improved as a result of studies employing RNA-Seq technology. Analysis of transcriptome alterations and gene expression also helps to understand the classification and progression of ovarian cancer \[4\].

## 3. **Conclusion**

The study of gene regulation has been significantly impacted by NGS technologies. RNA-seq has progressed so much in recent years that more current state-of-the-art technologies, such as high-density tiling arrays, seem antiquated. It seems likely that sequencing-based techniques will mostly take the place of hybridization-based techniques in the coming years \[3\]. With the use of this tool, researchers can compare tissues and cells under normal and abnormal conditions in order to track and uncover the causes of various diseases as well as identify metabolic abnormalities or alterations that occur at the molecular and cellular levels \[5\].
